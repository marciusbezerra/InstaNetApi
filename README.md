InstaNetApi is a complete Private Instagram API for .NET (C#, VB.NET) and also is a Fork of the InstagramApiSharp repository previously for internal use with several improvements and fixes.

As it is for internal use, for now, Dev does not feel the need to update it for users.

Let us know if you are interested in using the project, contributing to its development, or its presence on NuGet.
